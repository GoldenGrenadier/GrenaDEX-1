# GrenaDEX-1
This is old code I made for my custom "GrenaDEX"  video game controller. it is here mostly for posterity and
is admitedly badly written. 
In order to use this code, the teensyduino addon for the arduino IDE must be installed.
The hardware consists of a knock-off sega genesis controller(GN twin) with all of its components except for 
the conductive buttons removed. the D-pad was dremeled out and replaced with an analog stick from a Wii classic
controller. pins 0-8 are digital buttons which are connected to the afformentioned conductive buttons. analog pins
A0 and A1 are connected to the two potentiometers on the control stick.
